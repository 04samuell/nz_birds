## Extra Features

To each bird object I added some extra data:

- Min/Max Weight
- Min/Max Height
- Average Weight
- Average Height

All weight values are in grams for weight and centimetres for height.

This allowed for the following features:

> 1. Sorting

The data can be sorted by both weight ot height in both ascending and descending. 

> 2. Advanced filtering

By inputting a min and max weight/height value you can filter the results accordingly.
The bird is displayed if **either** the min or max value is within the bounds of the filter radius.
